       <li>sneeze</li>
       <li>handshake</li>
</ul>


The virus can also be transmitted by touching something an infected person has 
touched and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes.</p>

<p><b>Signs and Symptoms</b>

<br>The viruses can make people sick. Coronavirus symptoms include;
<ul>
